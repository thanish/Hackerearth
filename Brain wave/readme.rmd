Brainwave is a 4th edition of the machine learning competition hosted by Societe Generale. The first part of the competiton is online round which had two problems to solve.

1. A binary classification problem to predict the fraudulent transcation 
2. A Regression problem to predict the Annual return.

I have included my codes for both the problems in this repo. I finished 16th in the public leaderboard.
